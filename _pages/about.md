Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am interested in how we can enforce trustworthiness and interpretability in language modeling. I am excited about Reasoning for AI!
