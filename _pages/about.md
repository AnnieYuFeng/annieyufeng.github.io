Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on reasoning with a focus on how we can avoid factual errors, hallucinations, and biases and enforce faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning.
