HiðŸ‘‹! I am a third-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). I received my Master degree in Economics and Computer Science from Duke univeristy advised by Prof. [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). I graduated from Renmin Univeristy of China (RUC), majored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and minor in Computer Science. I worked with Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7Wa3GQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JNhNacoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at RUC. 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Iâ€™m particularly interested in:
* **Reliable LLM reasoning**, especially for complex intents, including complex reasoning, decision-making, planning and interactions. I am excited about how symbolic and probabilistic reasoning tools (via solvers, constraints, uncertainty and causality) can verify and guide an LLMâ€™s reasoning by enabling richer reward signals, more efficient synthetic supervision, better structure learning for abstraction, and stronger and more stable inference.
* **LLM agents and agentic training**, especially how models learn to plan, use external tools, and develop consistent world models. I am interested in how to design targeted environments, structured priors, and feedback loops that help models become more capable and grounded agents, and ultimately self-evolve through continuous interaction and reflection.
