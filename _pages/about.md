Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am interested in how we can enforce faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning.
