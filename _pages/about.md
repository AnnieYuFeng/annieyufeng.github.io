Hi! I am a second-year master student at Duke major in CS and Economics. I am advised by Prof.[Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). I am also fortunate to work closely with Prof.[Karl Stratos](https://karlstratos.com/#home). I did my summer internship at [cogcomp@UPenn]( https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/people/) this year advised by Prof.[Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/).


Hope you have a wonderful day!
