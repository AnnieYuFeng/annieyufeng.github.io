HiðŸ‘‹! I am a second-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). I received my Master degree in Economics and Computer Science from Duke univeristy advised by Prof. [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). I graduated from Renmin Univeristy of China (RUC), majored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and minor in Computer Science. I worked with Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7Wa3GQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JNhNacoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at RUC. 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Iâ€™m excited about LLM Reasoning and Agents. Iâ€™m particularly interested in:
* LLM reasoning for complex intents, including complex reasoning, decision-making, planning, and interactions.
* Analyzing and verifying the outputs of LLMs for more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.
