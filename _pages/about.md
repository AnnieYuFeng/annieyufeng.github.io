HiðŸ‘‹! I am a second-year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). 

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Iâ€™m excited about LLM Reasoning, Alignment, and Agents. Iâ€™m particularly interested in:
* LLM reasoning for complex intents, including complex reasoning, planning, and interactions.
* Developing post-training and inference-time methods for LLMs to perform more effective complex reasoning and decision-making.
* Analyzing and verifying the outputs of LLMs for more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.
